# freelancing activity

Cryptocurrencies have been one of my main interests for many, many years (since early 2013).

In 2020, through the Fiverr platform, I contributed to the creation of over 60 tokens and many presales across various networks for my clients. I have served as an advisor on projects with multi-million dollar market capitalizations.

In 2021, for one of my clients, I created the first memecoin on the Polygon (MATIC) network. The project turned out to be a massive success, and I was thrilled to remain the official advisor to the project until the end of the year. As of today, the token has nearly **250,000 holders** and a market capitalization of **12.6 million dollars**. After three years, the token also enjoys solid liquidity, with **$186,000 in the pool** and around **2,600 daily transactions**, which, by memecoin standards after so many years, is a fantastic result.

In collaboration with another Fiverr user, we developed a ready-made script for launching crypto farms (staking farm/yield farm). Users of these farms can deposit their BNB/AVAX/FTM/MATIC or other assets into a contract and, in return, receive farmers. The larger the share in the form of farmers, the greater the flow of rewards.

During my freelancing journey, I was also selling **cryptocurrency mining rig configurations**. As the demand for mining solutions grew, I offered my expertise to clients looking to set up efficient and profitable mining operations. (BIOS files and mostly, RX580 card configs)

In 2023, aiming to share all the knowledge I had acquired over the years, I wrote a modest guidebook on creating your own tokens, titled **"Your Own Token"**. The book is available on Amazon in two languages, in Polish on Empik, it was also available on my own store.
